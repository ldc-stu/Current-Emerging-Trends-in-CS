# Current-Emerging-Trends-in-CS

**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**

Centering on the topic of artifical intelligence, The main approach we explored during the course was reinforcement learning. We also delved into Deep Q learning neural networks and examined different AI strategies, such as those used in AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero. Providing a better understanding of the AI used in everyday, such as our phone assistant and even social media. With the application of this new technology in our lives we also give ourselves new problems of the ethical concerns, privacy and security that comes with AI. 

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**

Computer scientists specializing in artificial intelligence develop algorithms and models that enable machines to mimic human cognitive functions, such as learning, reasoning, and decision making. Their work is essential for advancing AI technologies that can improve industries like healthcare, finance, and transportation. Pushing the boundaries of AI, help create systems that can automate tasks, and provide insights that were previously beyond human reach.

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**

To approach a problem as a computer scientist, start by laying the problem out and breaking it down into smaller parts. Research already existing solutions and properly plan your solution with tools like pseudocode. Implement the solution step by step, testing and refining it as needed. Ensure your solution is working correctly and meets requirements before evaluating it.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**

You should design systems that are reliable, transparent, and free from bias, considering the potential impact on users' rights and well being. To the organization, your responsibilities involve maintaining integrity, being honest about the capabilities and limitations of your work; while also adhering to company policy/values while you reach your goal.
